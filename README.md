Dependent/Independent columns

In the dataset, we have dependent and independent column. Independent columns are the ones which do not influence the other column based on its value. depndent columns are the ones in which the values are dependent on the values of other columns. PFA the dependent/independent columns presernt in the dataset.

Dependent columns: stroke

Independent columns: id,gender,age,hypertension,heart_disease,ever_married,work_type,Residence_type,avg_glucose_level,bmi,smoking_status.

Supervised Learning:
This dataset is based on Supervised Learning. By calculating the independent columns, how they influence the dependent column. The model i'm trying to develop, is by using the independent column values, to predict whether the stroke will occur for a patient or not.
